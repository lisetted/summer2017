Here's the program I'm embedding:

Reflection:

I didn't recieve Elliot's email about creating a turtle hack before class, so I just copied a turtle (Turtle in space, https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/3bdab3639b) that was on the front page of trinket. After skimming the code to understand what the turtle was doing, I decided that I wanted to have the space ship draw as it moved. On my first attempt I tried adding the code for the line towards the beginning after the def statements.

```
# these defs control the movement of our "turtle"
def forward():
  turtle.forward(move_speed)

#draw lines behind spaceship
turtle.pendown()
turtle.color("yellow")
```

However, this was not the correct place to put it! This turned the screen white, with a yellow trangle for the spaceship and no lines being drawn. I checked the code again closely and noticed I didn't see all the code towards the bottom because I didn't scroll all the way down on both my browser and the code (rookie mistake!). At line 40, the original turtle author... To be continued.
